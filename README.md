# Auto-mileage-statistical-analysis

Final project for my ST-512(Methods of Data Analysis) course which describes my research to apply statistical methods in a dataset to describe the correlation between different exploratory variables.

I'm using the mpg-dataset provided, which stands for mileage per gallon performance of various cars which is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal of this research is to answer these 2 research questions:
1. Finding out the statistically significant factors that are responsible for the mean miles per gallon variable after accounting for the weight of the vehicle?
2. Does the effect of weight on mean miles per gallon depend on the horsepower of the vehicle?

More information about this analysis and the results could be found in the file ST-512_finalProject_makwanas.pdf. 

Here are some of the ss of the results obtained by my statistical reseach:
